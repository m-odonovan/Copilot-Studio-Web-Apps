## Javascript - Chat - Floating Window
This is a single HTML page sample. It uses Botframework webchat javascript library to create the user experience. It allows for text based chat. This sample is similar to the Javascript - Chat sample, but it provides a floating chat window, which can be dragged around the screen.
