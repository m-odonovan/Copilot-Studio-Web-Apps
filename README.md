# Copilot Studio Web Apps
These are samples that I have used to demonstrate various web experiences for Copilot Studio bots. Most of the source for these has been derived from the samples found at https://github.com/microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat/tree/main/samples.

These samples are provided as-is. They have not been tested in production scenarios. They are merely demonstrations of how to achieve various custome user experiences using Copilot Studio.
